# MCMCLib
This library provides functionality for specifying and running Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. It offers base classes for specifying a hypothesis space, likelihood model, proposal distribution and sampling using MCMC techniques.
Currently only Metropolis-Hasting sampler is available. Other samplers (e.g., parallel tempering, sequential parallel tempering) will be added in the future.
